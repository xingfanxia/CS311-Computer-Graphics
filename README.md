## Computer Graphics Exercise

### 020 Rasterizing Triangle

Just draw triangles.

### 030 Interpolating Triangle

Draw triangles with color interpolated from 3 vertices.

### 040 Texturing

Draw triangle's RGB value base on a texture. i.e. filling the triangle with texture by interpolating texture coordinates and perform lookups in texture file.

### 050-60 Abstracting Interface

Generalize and abstract an universal interface for easier access and call.

### 070-80 Mesh

Drawing meshes (collection of triangles).

### 090 Scene Graph

Draw simple scene graphs. Introduce scene with nodes of meshes.

### 100 Draw 3D Scenes

Introduce 3D, some simple modification based on 2D does the job.

### 110 Draw 3D with Depth in Consideration

Modification on 100 to comply with introduction of the concept of Depth. Apply the Z-buffer to engine.
